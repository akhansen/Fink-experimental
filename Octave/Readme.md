Terms of usage:

This subdirectory inherits the terms of usage outlined in [../Readme.md](https://github.com/akhansen/Fink-experimental/blob/master/Readme.md)

This directory contains Octave packaging and packaging for related items.  

Packaging for various versions of the Octave main package and its documentation is in this directory.

Octave Forge packages are now in Fink's `libs/octmods` (this change was made without my permission--I personally would have picked `sci/octmods`).  In this repository these are in the `octmods` directory.

The `unofficial` directory contains packaging for items that can't be in Fink.
