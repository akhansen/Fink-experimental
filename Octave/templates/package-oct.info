Package: @FORGE_NAME@-oct%type_pkg[oct]
Version: @VERSION@
Revision: @REVISION@

# Packages that support Octave 3.4.3 and earlier typically link to gcc4N-shlibs,
# and need Type: gcc (@type_gcc) added.
Type: oct (@OCTVERSIONS@), forge (@FORGE_NAME@)

# Packages which support Octave < 3.6.4 also need
# Distribution: ( %type_pkg[oct] << 364 ) 10.7, ( %type_pkg[oct] << 364 ) 10.8

# All packages need at least these BuildDepends, with the following exceptions:
# 1.  Packages which aren't for Octave-3.0.5 can just declare a dependency on hdf5.8
# 2.  Packages which don't need other packages don't need to have the versioned fink
# 	  dependency.
#
# In addition, packages which support Octave 3.4.3 and earlier will need to replace
# liboctave%type_pkg[oct]-dev with  
# ( %type_pkg[oct] << 360 ) liboctave%type_pkg[oct]-gcc%type_pkg[gcc]-dev,
#
# (or simply add it) if they link to any gcc4N libraries. gcc%type_pkg[gcc]-compiler is 
# already in the Depends of every octave*-dev package.
#
# The particular versioning on fink-octave-scripts indicates the first version which
# contained compiler wrappers.
BuildDepends: <<
  liboctave%type_pkg[oct]-dev, 
  fftw3,
  hdf5.8,
  fink (>=0.32),

DescPackaging: <<
This package:
# Note below applies to packages which support older Octaves in addition to 3.6.4+
Hideous Distribution tagging is so that we can keep a *single* .info file in the
10.7 tree that covers all octversions for 10.7/10.8, but keeps only 3.6.4+ for 10.9.  
This is by design.  Don't touch this file without my permission.

@ADDITIONAL_DESCPACKAGING@

Common for all octave-forge packages:
Preinst and postinst scripts are dynamically set up via 
%p/share/fink-octave-scripts/octave-forge-patch.sh because Octave's package manager 
can't cope with non-literal arguments.

The Type: forge (pkgname) is used to minimize what needs to be changed when
using this .info file as a template.

# Add additional Desc* fields as required.
