Description: Generic Polygon Clipper Library
DescDetail: <<
The University of Manchester GPC library 
(wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPC_General_Polygon_Clipper_Library)
is a flexible and highly robust polygon set operations library for use with 
C, C#, Delphi, Java, Perl, Python, Haskell, Lua, VB.Net (and other) 
applications, as referenced in the comp.graphics.algorithms FAQ 
( http://www.faqs.org/faqs/graphics/algorithms-faq/ )
and the UIUC Computational Geometry Page. 
( http://compgeom.cs.uiuc.edu/%7Ejeffe/compgeom/ )

GPC Features:

* Difference, intersection, exclusive-or and union clip operations are 
  supported.
* Polygons may be comprised of multiple disjoint contours.
* Contour vertices may be given in any order - clockwise or anticlockwise.
* Contours may be convex, concave or self-intersecting.
* Contours may be nested (i.e. polygons may have holes).
* Output may take the form of either polygon contours or tristrips.
* Hole and external contours are differentiated in the result.
* Coincident edges and degenerate regions are handled correctly.
