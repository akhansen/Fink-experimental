octave305 also works.

--------------------

octave324, 343, 360-364, and 381 appear to be doing the right thing.
octave305 is currently in testing.

I'll start with Octave-forge packages afterwards.

fink-octave-scripts replaces older octave3*-dev so that it can take charge of oct-cc and oct-cxx.
Current octave3*-dev have Depends: fink-octave-scripts (>=0.3.0-1).
