Description: Approximate nearest neighbors

What is ANN?
ANN is a library written in C++, which supports data structures and algorithms
for both exact and approximate nearest neighbor searching in arbitrarily high
dimensions.
In the nearest neighbor problem a set of data points in d-dimensional space is
given. These points are preprocessed into a data structure, so that given any
query point q, the nearest or generally k nearest points of P to q can be
reported efficiently. The distance between two points can be defined in many
ways. ANN assumes that distances are measured using any class of distance
functions called Minkowski metrics. These include the well known Euclidean
distance, Manhattan distance, and max distance.

Based on our own experience, ANN performs quite efficiently for point sets
ranging in size from thousands to hundreds of thousands, and in dimensions as
high as 20. (For applications in significantly higher dimensions, the results
are rather spotty, but you might try it anyway.)

The library implements a number of different data structures, based on kd-trees
and box-decomposition trees, and employs a couple of different search
strategies.

The library also comes with test programs for measuring the quality of
performance of ANN on any particular data sets, as well as programs for
visualizing the structure of the geometric data structures.

Why /approximate/ nearest neighbors?
Computing exact nearest neighbors in dimensions much higher than 8 seems to be
a very difficult task. Few methods seem to be significantly better than a
brute-force computation of all distances. However, it has been shown that by
computing nearest neighbors approximately, it is possible to achieve
significantly faster running times (on the order of 10's to 100's) often with a
relatively small actual errors. ANN allows the user to specify a maximum
approximation error bound, thus allowing the user to control the tradeoff
between accuracy and running time.
