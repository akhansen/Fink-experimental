# Packages which serve only Octave-3.0.5 or only Octave > 3.0.5 need

# Similarly, this conditional can be dropped if only Octaves >= 3.6.0 are supported.

# Packages that use BLAS or LAPACK will need to specify the the
# variants separately:

DescPackaging: <<
This package:
(If appropriate)

Common for all octave-forge packages:
We read in postinst and prerm template scripts installed by octaveN and modify
them to use the name of this package because Octave's package manager can't 
cope with non-literal arguments.

The Type: forge (pkgname) is used to minimize what needs to be changed when
using this .info file as a template, or when the package name doesn't match 
the archive name.
